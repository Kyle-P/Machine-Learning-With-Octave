# Neural Networks and Multi-Class Classification
This folder contains a one-vs-all classification algorithm implemented with logistic regression. Also coded a forward propogation algorithm for neural networks with the weights already fitted. My code for in-depth neural networks where the weights aren't provided can be found in the ["Neural Networks In-Depth" directory](https://github.com/Kyle-P/Machine-Learning-With-Octave/tree/master/Neural%20Networks%20In-Depth).

## Specifics
This folder contains programs that train an ML model to recognize handwritten numbers.

## Our Dataset
A matrix of numerical values calculated from 20 by 20 pixel images of handwritten digits.
