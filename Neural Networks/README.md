# Neural Networks
These programs train a neural network to recognize handwritten Arabic numerals (from 0 to 9). First, we randomly 

## Random Initialization of Weights
## Forward Propagation
## Backpropagation
## Sigmoid Gradient
## Gradient Checking

## Dataset (ex4data1.mat)
The dataset used in these programs is written in an Octave/MATLAB compatible file. It contains a matrix of numerical values derived from images of handwritten Arabic numerals.

## Directions
* Run neuralNetworkDigitRecognition.m to create and train a neural network.

## Disclaimer
* ex4.m, ex4data1.mat, ex4weights.mat, displayData.m , fmincg.m , computeNumericalGradient.m, checkNNGradients.m, debugInitializeWeights.m, and predict.m were all provided by a course I'm enrolled in.

## Note
fmincg.m is just a better optimized function that calculates the same thing as the fminunc function native to Octave.
