# Multivariate Linear Regression With Gradient Descent
Multivariate linear regression is an algorithm in which machine learning can be implemented to produce a linear model of a set of data. The set can have multiple variables, or parameters, in this case. There are some differences such as the necessity of feature normalization in multivariate linear regression.
