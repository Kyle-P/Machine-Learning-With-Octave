# Univariate Linear Regression With Gradient Descent
Univariate linear regression is an algorithm in which machine learning can be implemented to produce a linear model of a set of data. The set of data will only have one parameter, or variable, in this case.

## Directions
* Run linearRegress.m to run univariate linear regression with gradient descent 

## Other Notes
Computing the cost function is unnecessary in termas of gradient descent and running linear regression. We just include it here as a way of monitoring the progress of gradient descent and to make sure it's converging to a minimum. 

## Disclaimer
* linearRegress.m and ex1data1.txt were both provided by a course I'm enrolled in. However, some comments in linearRegress.m were developed by me.
