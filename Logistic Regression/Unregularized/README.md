# Unregularized Logistic Regression
An unregularized implementation of logistic regression with gradient descent and advanced optimization techniques!

## Dataset (ex2data1.txt)
The dataset used in these programs represents student scores on two different tests. My programs use machine learning to classify/predict, based on the data, whether or not a student will be accepted into a certain college. The first two columns are the test scores and the third column of the data (0 or 1) represents whether or not that student was accepted into the college (1 = accepted). We then use the data that we trained on to predict the result of future students based on their scores.

## Directions
* Run logisticRegressUnreg.m to run unregularized logistic regression with two approaches - gradient descent and the fminunc function.

## Disclaimer
* logisticRegressUnreg.m, plotData.m, plotDecisionBoundary.m, and ex2data1.txt were both provided by a course I'm enrolled in.
